```bash
gnome-extensions install rounded-window-corners@yilozt.shell-extension.zip
```

## Translations

To add new translations for extensions, you can add empty `.po` file to `po` directory, then use `yarn po` to fill it. 

```bash
touch po/zh_CN.po  # replace zh_CN to the locales you want to add
yarn po            # auto fill po file
vim po/zh_CN.po    # now let's start edit
```

You can run `yarn dev` in terminal to watch changes of `.po` files, it will compile and install extensions automatically. In XOrg sessions, press `Alt + F2 -> r` to reload gnome-shell to preview the result.

## Development

### Build

```bash
yarn build 
```

### Watch files

Build and install extensions when files in `src` folder changed.

```
yarn dev
```

### Test in Virtual Box by Vagrant

Need to install [`Vagrant`](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant) and Virtual Box. This command will setup a virtual machine that enable log of extensions in terminal.

```
yarn vm
```
